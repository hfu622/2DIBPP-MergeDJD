# DJD++: Improving the DJD Heuristic for the Two-Dimensional Irregular Bin Packing Problem

## Introduction

This project introduces a new algorithm, **DJD++**, which improves upon the existing DJD heuristic to solve the **Two-Dimensional Irregular Bin Packing Problem**. The problem is based on packing rectangular bins with pieces that are polygons—both convex and non-convex shapes are supported. The shapes contain no curves.

### Applicable Scenarios:

* **Bins**: Rectangular in shape.
* **Pieces**: Convex or non-convex polygonal shapes without any curves.
* **Use Cases**: Suitable for learning, demonstrations, and practical applications.

## Demonstration Example of DJD++ Packing
This page is the main entry of the project.

After entering the demonstration page, you can:
- Select a **built-in example**, or
- **Upload your own input files**.

Currently, the supported file formats are:
- `JSON`
- `TXT`

The upload rules and file format specifications can be viewed by clicking the button in the top-right corner of the page.

- The uploaded or selected input data will be displayed in the lower section of the page.

- Click the **Calculate** button to start the packing computation.
- The computation time depends on:
  - The performance of the user's computer
  - The size and complexity of the input data

## System Requirements

* **JDK Version**: jdk-1.8
* **Maven Version**: Apache Maven 3.8.7

## Notice

* If the input file is **.txt**, make sure that each line starts with a **space**.
* The web visualization uses the top-left corner of each bin as the origin, while our code uses the bottom-left corner. To view the packing result in the **correct orientation**, simply flip the images upside down.
