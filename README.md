# DJD++: Improving the DJD Heuristic for the Two-Dimensional Irregular Bin Packing Problem

![DJD++ Algorithm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1643c2b6-b08a-434e-bade-f93a26152bd8)

## Introduction

This project introduces a new algorithm, **DJD++**, which improves upon the existing DJD heuristic to solve the **Two-Dimensional Irregular Bin Packing Problem**. The problem is based on packing rectangular bins with pieces that are polygons—both convex and non-convex shapes are supported. The shapes contain no curves.

### Applicable Scenarios:

* **Bins**: Rectangular in shape.
* **Pieces**: Polygonal shapes (can be either convex or non-convex), without any curves.
* **Use Cases**: Suitable for learning, demonstrations, and practical applications.
